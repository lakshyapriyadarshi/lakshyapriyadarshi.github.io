The above steps enable Unicode Standard emoji characters and sequences in Hugo, however the rendering of these glyphs depends on the browser and the platform. To style the emoji you can either use a third party emoji font or a font stack; e.g.\n1.emoji { 2font-family: Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, NotoColorEmoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Android Emoji, EmojiSymbols; 3}","date":"Mar 5, 2019","img":"","permalink":"/en/posts/emoji-support/","series":null,"tags":["Emoji"],"title":"Emoji Support"},{"categories":null,"content":"Written in Go, Hugo is an open source static site generator available under the Apache Licence 2.0.
